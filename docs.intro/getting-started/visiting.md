After joining our server, We currently have two main servers which are available for visitors.
## 1. Master Server
This is the main server where our Official Builders use to build the Earth.
You can visit our build sites such as `Kuala Lumpur`, `Bangkok`, `Ho Chi Minh`, `Jakarta, Manila`, `Singapore`,... here.

:::danger Bedrock Edition is not supported in the master server
This is because we have a mod called `Cubic Chunks` in our master server that extends the world height to infinity. The mod exists only in Java edition.
:::

:::tip We support 1.20 Minecraft
Since we support 1.20 Minecraft you can join on any version from 1.20.1 to 1.20.4 and you do not need the BTE Modpack
